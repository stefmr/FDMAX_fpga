# FDMAX - Laplace implementation on FPGA

Done (?):
    - Processing element.

To implement:
    - Define parametric weights for different grid sizes.
    - DIFF computing unit (DCU).
    - DDR-FPGA memory interface.
    - Define configurations for multiple differential equations (Poisson, Heat, Wave).
    - Add pipelines.
